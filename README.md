# QOL (Ver.1)
------------------
for JET v1.1.1
by King

# What is QOL?
 "Quality of Life" is a specific set of user experience tweaks to make game as "realistic as playable".
 
 **If you have Removin' and Customizin' and/or Instant Deploy, you can delete those individual mods because they are baked into QoL


## Installation

1. Extract archive to your `server folder/user/mods` folder 
    * Folder structure should look like `server folder/user/mods/King-QOL-X.X.X`
2. Close your server (if it's running)
3. Edit `config.json` in your preferred text editor/IDE, review/modify any settings, then save and close
4. Delete your `server folder/user/cache` folder
5. Run your server (it should generate a new cache)

* If you change a setting in `config.json`, repeat steps 2-5 above


## Files

- If any of the files below are missing/misplaced, you may have to redownload/reinstall this archive:
    * `src/QOLCache.js`
    * `src/QOLTamper.js`
    * `mod.config.json`
    * `config.json`
    * `README.md`
